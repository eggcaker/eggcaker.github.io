---

I plan move all my workflow and codding work into wsl. Just because the magit's performance issue on windows make me wanna cry.
There are is how I setup the workflow and configurations.

### Install WSL distrbution
I choice debian over Ubuntu, hard to say ubuntu is not good, just personal choice.

### Install Emacs and some gui applications

To use the gui version of emacs,should join the weindows insider preview as writting time.
- Emacs
- Nyxt (a lisp based keyboar driving webbrowser, everything is hackable)

### Config the windows emacsclient to open file from Emacs on WSL
- Set =server_name= in emacs configuations to emacs_server_27_2
- Create a exe to wrapper the wsl's emacsclient to open file(deno version)
```
const ff_cmd = Deno.run ({ cmd: ["wsl", "wslpath", "-a", Deno.args[0].replaceAll("\\", "/")],stdout: "piped", stderr: "piped"});
const ff = await ff_cmd.output();
ff_cmd.close();
const fp =new TextDecoder().decode(ff);
const p = Deno.run({ cmd: ["wsl", "emacsclient", "--create-frame", "--socket-name=*mnt*wslg*runtime-dir*emacs/emacs_server_27_2", fp]});
await p.status();
```

- compile this scrip to exe with deno
```
deno compile --allow-run wslemacsclient.ts
```
- copy the generated wslemacsclient to some directory in $PATH
- edit regstration with regedit add =OpenWith ...=
```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell\Open with WSL EmacsClient\command]
@="wslemacsclient.exe %1 /s"
```
